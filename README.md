### Challenge One
Challenge One description "Komodo cafe is getting a new menu. The manager wants to be able to create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app."

In this challenge I was able to properly implement a method to create, delete, and list all of the menu items for the cafe.

### Challenge Two
Challenge Two description "Komodo has a bug in its software and needs some new code. Komodo allows an insurance claim to be made up to 30 days after an incident took place. If the claim is not in the proper time limit, it is not valid."

I created a method to see all of the claims, have the ability to take care of the next claim in the queue, and the ability to enter a new claim to be processed.

### Challenge Three
Challenge Three description "An app that maintains a dictionary of details about employee badge information."

I created an app that allows the user to add a badge to the program and be able to list doors that, that specific badge has access to. The program also has the ability to edit a badge by taking away door access or providing access to a new door. The program also has the ability to list all the badges currently in the program.
